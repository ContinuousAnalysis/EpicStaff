## üöÄ Getting Started

This guide will help you launch EpicStaff using our system installer, which manages the Docker containers for you.

### Windows/Linux

### 1. **Install dependencies**  
   - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)  
   - [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

### 2. Download the Installer
Download the latest release for your operating system from our releases page.
- **‚û° [Download Latest Release](https://github.com/EpicStaff/EpicStaff/releases)**

### 3. Unzip and Run
Unzip the downloaded file and run the EpicStaff application.
 
**For more [details](docs/docs.pdf)**

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Important Step for macOS Users**

Before running the application on macOS for the first time, you need to grant it execution permissions.

**Why is this necessary?**
macOS has a security feature called Gatekeeper that can block applications downloaded from the internet. The following commands simply tell your system that you trust EpicStaff and allow it to run.

Open your terminal navigate to the unzipped directory and run these two commands:
```bash
chmod -R epicstaff.app
xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine epicstaff.app
```

---

### MacOS Launch Instructions (Manual)

### 1. Clone the Project
`git clone -b stable --single-branch https://github.com/EpicStaff/EpicStaff.git`
### 2. Change .env file
```bash
sed -i '' 's|CREW_SAVEFILES_PATH=/c/savefiles|CREW_SAVEFILES_PATH=~/savefiles|' src/.env
```
Replace ~/savefiles with your preferred location
### 3. Make sure you have Docker installed and running
### 4. Use next command to run the project
```bash
cd src && docker volume create sandbox_venvs && docker volume create sandbox_executions && docker volume create crew_pgdata && docker volume create crew_config && docker-compose up --build
```

## One Platform, Two Workflows: Visual and Code

We built EpicStaff to serve everyone involved in building AI-powered solutions, from business analysts to senior developers.

### üîπ For Business Teams & No-Code Users: Visual AI Project Builder

Create powerful, multitasking AI agents through our intuitive **visual AI workflow builder**. Use a node-based **graphic interface** to connect pre-built blocks for text analysis, response generation, file management, CRM integration and more. Go from idea to a functional AI agent **without writing a single line of code**.

### üîπ For Developers: A High-Performance FastAPI Multi-Agent Backend

Get full control with a modular transparent **open-source FastAPI backend**. Dive deep into our **event-driven architecture** to customize orchestration logic define **fine-grained task control** and integrate custom Python tools seamlessly. No black boxes, no magic just a clean extensible **RESTful agent orchestration** framework that respects your need for control.

**Whether you're experimenting, prototyping or deploying to production EpicStaff adapts to you:**
* Use the **drag-and-drop visual interface** when speed is key.
* Dive into the **Python backend** when custom logic is required.
* Combine both approaches seamlessly in a single project.

> We hide the complexity, not the logic.

## Who is EpicStaff For?

* **AI Developers** seeking a flexible **FastAPI agent framework** without rigid templates.
* **Business Teams** who need to quickly **build custom AI workflows** for automation.
* **No-code/Low-code users** who prefer a **visual interface** over YAML or complex scripts.
* **R&D Teams & Startups** prototyping and deploying **scalable agentic systems**.
